# ðŸŽ® Unity Games Showcase  

> _"Soon, you'll be exploring my world of creativity and fun."_  

Welcome to my **Unity Games Repository**! ðŸš—âœ¨  
Here, I'll share the games I've created, ranging from relaxing drives through picturesque landscapes to thrilling adventures in immersive worlds.

## ðŸ•’ What's Coming Soon?  
I can't upload my Unity projects directly to GitHub because of the **file size limitations**, but donâ€™t worry! Iâ€™ll find a workaround soon, such as:  
- Uploading playable builds to platforms like **Itch.io** or **Google Drive**.  
- Sharing smaller, optimized project files and snippets for you to explore.

## ðŸš§ Current Progress  
- ðŸŒŸ **Crusin'kopia**: (driving game) A relaxing driving game with a Genshin-like vibe and Firewatch-style visuals.  
- ðŸ”§ Working on features like **Spotify playlist integration** and **toon-shaded maps**.  

**Thanks for stopping by!** ðŸ™Œ
